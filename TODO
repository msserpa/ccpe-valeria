We already observed the impact in the simulation accuracy when the prefetcher is not modeled by the simulator.
Zsim registers a high number of LLC accesses that would be prevented by the prefetcher, similar to the results observed in the real execution with the prefetcher disabled.
However, in a simulator that do model the prefetcher, how accurate its implementation is?
In order to be able to determine this accuracy, we must at first understand how we can quantify it.
Accuracy is defined by which parameters? 
Number of LLC accesses?
And what about the cache pollution?
And the usefulness of the prefetched lines?

Since both L1 and L2 data prefetchers impact in the number of requests that reach the uncore, they were both disabled for the real executions without the prefetcher.

Something that we must ensure is to test with applications with a bigger input size and different communication patterns (preferably more heterogeneous applications).
Shall we consider different prefetchers in the real executions?
For example, different prefetchers in different cache levels?
If so, is that an option also in the simulators?
If it is, then shall we perform a comparison among the accuracy of the different possible configurations?
